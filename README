This is my collection of Vim plugins and configuration.  I use it primarily for Ruby on Rails development. It includes everything you need for Rails dev (JS, HTML, CSS included). It also includes Jamisâ€™ supercool fuzzy_finder_textmate plugin. Just do a:

git clone git@github.com:manalang/vim-config.git

Then:

mv vim-config ~/.vim 
mv ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

Enjoy!
